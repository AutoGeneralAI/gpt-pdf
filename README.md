# gpt-pdf

English | [简体中文](./README_zh.md)

"gpt-pdf.ipynb is a code that runs on Google Colab, while main.py is a regular Python code that can be run independently. 

> Both codes implement the same function: translating PDF documents. They are independent of each other and can be used as a reference for experience. 

If you do not need translation but want to analyze the content of a PDF document or ask questions about the PDF document content, you can modify the dialogue content in the code "Please assist me in translating the following technical document into Simplified Chinese" to meet your specific needs. 

> A typical commercial website that implements similar functionality is https://www.chatpdf.com/.
